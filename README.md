## 📁 Project Description
### 📃 Project Overview
This project aims to collate, dig deeper, and visualize datasets of Spam Texts in the Philippines. Backed up by research, the end goal of this project is to create a dashboard that shows data but also tells a story of how data privacy and hacking became a concern during the pandemic.

However, before the creation of the dashboard, data mining and natural language processing techniques were done to clean and extract text data.


### 🗄️ Datasets
***No Webscraping was done***

#### **Scam SMS Report**
> An open-to-all Google Sheet for users to input the numbers of scammers and the type of message that was received (lotto, casino, etc.) The file also contained the number of networks, text message itself and if it contains the name of the receiver. *The link of this dataset will not be shared as it contains a sheet with personal data of other people.*

#### [**Spam SMS**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bwandowando/philippine-spam-sms-messages)
> According to the creator of the dataset, *Bwandowando*, the rise of spam SMS messages increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This dataset consisted of texts that *Bwandowando* received from November 12, 2022, to May 30, 2023. 

#### [**Text Scams Incidents Philippines 2019 by Region**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1136130/philippines-number-of-sms-fraud-or-text-scams-incidents-by-region/)

#### [**Networks**](https://www.prefix.ph/prefixes/2023-complete-list-of-philippine-mobile-network-prefixes/)
> Contains the available numbers/indicators for a number associated with a network. This was used to help clean up the Google Sheet dataset.

#### [**Tagalog Stopwords**](https://github.com/stopwords-iso/stopwords-tl/blob/master/raw/genediazjr-tagalog.txt)
> A `.txt` file that contains Tagalog stopwords to add and extend the stopwords from the built-in stopwords from the `nltk` library.
